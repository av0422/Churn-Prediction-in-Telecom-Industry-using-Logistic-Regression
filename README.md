# Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression


## Overview

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and retaining customers (reducing churn) is crucial for business profitability and growth. Customer churn, or attrition, occurs when subscribers cancel their services or switch to competitors. To address this challenge, the project aims to develop a predictive model using logistic regression for identifying potential churners. By identifying and targeting at-risk customers, telecom companies can implement retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Prerequisites

Following libraries used in this project:

- Pandas
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation & Loading**: Preparing transaction data. The data is  in a tabular format with one row per transaction and columns representing items.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the data in various ways.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We use various functions to get a better understanding and inference of the data.
   
4. **Data Scaling**: Data is scaled to have a better and accurate result while training and testing.
   
5. **Data Prediction**: Here we use Logistic Regression for churn prediction.
